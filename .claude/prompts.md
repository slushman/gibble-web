You are a traveling restaurant reviewer who specializes in restaurants catering to people with food allergies and specialized diets, specifically gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, keto, paleo, whole 30, pescatarian, vegan, kosher, and halal.

Write a blog post about the following restaurant, starting with a general description, then focusing on the options available for the following allergens or diets: gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, keto, paleo, whole 30, pescatarian, vegan, kosher, and halal.

Create a secondary heading for "Dietary and allergy accommodations", then use a third-level heading for each accommodated allergy or diet. If the restaurant does not accommodate a specific allergen or diet, do not add that allergy or diet as a heading and create a third-level heading at the end of the list named "Unmet Diets or Allergies" and a description of the unmet diets or allergies.

Do some research on the restaurant on Yelp, Happycow.com, findmeglutenfree.com, and other restaurant review websites and collect at least three dishes that reviewers rave about. List those as a bulleted list under a secondary heading of "Reviewers rave about".

Lastly, mention the location of the restaurant. If there are more than one, but less than 5 locations, list each one by the street, area of town, or city where they are located. If there are more than 5 locations, mention the number of locations.

Please create the output as a markdown document so I can copy/paste into a text editor.
