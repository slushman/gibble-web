Founded in the mid-1960s in Atlanta, Georgia, Chick-fil-A has since grown to become one of the largest quick-service chicken chains in the world. Chick-fil-A has options for many diets and like their famous customer service, they take food allergies and dietary restrictions seriously when informed. Let’s start by exploring the gluten-free options.\n\nChick-fil-A offers a variety of gluten-free options, including their grilled chicken sandwich served on a gluten-free bun. They also have gluten-free salads, wraps, and sides such as waffle potato fries.\n\nFor those avoiding dairy, Chick-fil-A offers a dairy-free dipping sauce made with a blend of herbs, spices, and a hint of lemon. And for a delicious dairy-free option, try their grilled chicken nuggets.\n\nFor those avoiding nuts, Chick-fil-A uses peanut oil for all their fried items. According to their frequently asked questions, the oil is refined, bleached, and deodorized, which means the proteins in the oil are stripped out during processing. According to the FDA, that makes the peanut oil no longer a major allergen. However, follow the advice of your healthcare provider for you dietary restrictions,\n\nChick-fil-A has options for those following a keto or whole 30 diet, including grilled chicken nuggets, salads, and wraps made with lettuce instead of a bun. They also have a variety of low-carb sides like their superfood side, which includes kale and broccolini.\n\nFor those following a paleo diet, in addition to the options above for keto and whole 30 dieters, Chick-fil-A offers their grilled market salad, made with mixed greens, grilled chicken, and a variety of fresh veggies. These options are free from grains, legumes, and dairy, making them a great choice for those following a paleo lifestyle.\n\nSome Chick-fil-A locations do not serve any breaded items during the Passover holiday, so at least for that time, at certain locations, it is considered kosher for Passover. However, outside of Passover season and at those locations, it is not considered kosher.\n\nUnfortunately, Chick-fil-A does not offer vegetarian, pescatarian, vegan or halal options at this time.","src/content/restaurants/chick-fil-a.mdx","69ab18e84643c502","chick-fil-a.mdx","chipotle",{"id":312,"data":314,"body":324,"filePath":325,"digest":326,"legacyId":327,"deferredRender":35},{"title":315,"city":295,"state":296,"website":316,"categories":317,"allergens":319,"videos":320,"draft":29,"isNationalChain":35,"region":296},"Chipotle","https://www.chipotle.com/",[20,318,19,43,59,300,301,302],"Mexican",[],[321],{"name":322,"url":323},"Allergen-Friendly Options at Chipotle","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_Bo3jHhyDU","Chipotle is a popular restaurant chain known for its delicious burritos, bowls, and tacos, but did you know that they also offer a variety of options for those with food allergies or dietary restrictions? Let's take a closer look.\n\nFirst, let's talk about Chipotle's allergen statement. They have a comprehensive guide on their website that lists all of the ingredients they use and any potential allergens that may be present in their dishes. The guide shows which foods contain gluten, dairy, soy, and sulfites. There is also a guide for special diets like vegan, vegetarian, keto, paleo, and Whole30. This makes it easy for customers to make informed decisions about what to order.\n\nNext, we have the option of ordering a burrito, bowl or a taco in a lettuce wrap instead of a tortilla or a bowl. This is a great option for those who are gluten-free.\n\nChipotle also offers a variety of vegetarian and vegan options, including their Sofritas, which is a spicy, shredded tofu, their plant-based chorizo, and their black and pinto beans, which are both vegan.\n\nIn addition, Chipotle also has a variety of toppings and sides that are dairy-free, such as their fresh salsa and guacamole.\n\nChipotle offers a variety of options for those with nut allergies, as they do not use any peanuts or tree nuts in their dishes or in their kitchens.\n\nFor those following kosher or halal diets, Chipotle is neither kosher, nor halal. Halal diners mention sticking to vegetarian or vegan options and avoiding the meats altogether.\n\nFinally, Chipotle states they do not use mustard, peanuts, tree nuts, sesame, shellfish, or fish as ingredients in their food. They also only use eggs in locations serving breakfast items. \n\nIf you're following a specific diet such as paleo, keto, or Whole30, Chipotle has options for you as well. You can order a bowl with a base of lettuce, meat, and vegetables, and avoid the beans and rice, which are not paleo or Whole30 compliant. Additionally, Chipotle offers a variety of salsas and guacamole that can add flavor without adding unwanted carbs for those following a keto diet.\n\nSo, whether you're gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, paleo, keto, Whole30, or have an allergy to nuts, peanuts, shellfish, eggs, mustard, or sesame, Chipotle has options for you.
