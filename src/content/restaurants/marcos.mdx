Opened in 2008, Marco’s Coal Fired Pizzeria is the first certified Neapolitan pizzeria in Colorado. They have won many awards and been voted top pizza in Denver and the United States on multiple occasions.

For gluten-free diners, they detail their gluten-free prep and cooking processes on their website, including using a separate oven. They also sell gluten-free beers.

For dairy-free, vegan and, vegetarian diners, they have a separate vegan menu including pizzas with vegan cheese.

Reviewers rave about how Marcos has the best gluten-free crust and how it compares to “regular” pizza and:
* Pudding
* Limoncello chicken wings
* Sicilian pizza
* Margherita pizza
* Nutella dessert pizza

Marco’s Coal Fired Pizzeria has two locations, the original on Larimer Street two blocks from Coors Field and the second on Inverness Main Street in Englewood.
