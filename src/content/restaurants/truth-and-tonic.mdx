Tucked discreetly on the 4th floor of The Venetian Resort, adjacent to the Canyon Ranch Spa + Fitness, Truth & Tonic is a wellness-oriented café focused on clean, plant-centric cuisine (with some options for animal proteins) and nutrient-dense preparations. The restaurant operates from early morning through mid-afternoon (typically 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.) and serves breakfast and lunch.

Though it’s on the Strip, Truth & Tonic is a bit hidden—visitors often remark on how tricky it is to locate within the Venetian/Palazzo complex. Access may require ID or “buzzing” through security to use the guest elevators.

What sets it apart is its wellness ethos: superfood ingredients, anti-inflammatory additives (turmeric, mushroom powder, etc.), careful menu labeling (vegan, gluten-free, “free of cross-contamination” claims), and an aesthetic that blends café comfort with a spa-like calm.

Because of that positioning, Truth & Tonic tends to attract guests seeking lighter, cleaner fare amid the indulgent options that often dominate The Strip.

## Reviewers rave about
Here are three (or more) dishes that get frequent praise in reviews:
* Soyrizo Burrito — a plant-based breakfast wrap that many diners note is filling and flavorful.
* Coconut Milk French Toast — a vegan spin on classic French toast (with fruit, maple syrup) that gets singled out as a standout.
* Avocado & Greens Toast (with optional Just Egg added) — simple but praised for its freshness and balance.

Other items frequently mentioned positively include the “chicken” wrap (plant-based “chicken” alternative), various grain or salad bowls, and the tofu scramble / Just Egg frittata-style dishes.

## Dietary & allergy accommodations

Here’s how Truth & Tonic measures up when you impose constraints like gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, keto, paleo, Whole30, pescatarian, vegan, kosher, halal.

### Gluten-free

Truth & Tonic explicitly offers several gluten-free options (labeled “GF” on the menu) for smoothies, toasts (or modifications), and other dishes. They also emphasize that their vegan dishes are prepared “free from cross-contamination.”

However, not all items are gluten-free by default (e.g. their “toast” or burrito wrap uses wheat). If you have celiac disease, you should ask staff about preparation and confirm cross-contact protocols.

### Dairy-free

Because the café is heavily vegan-minded, many dishes are dairy-free (i.e. free of cow’s milk, butter, cheese). Their vegan menu is built around plant milks, nut milks (e.g. almond milk in smoothies), and non-dairy alternatives. That said, some menu items (when not ordered in vegan form) may include dairy (e.g. queso fresco, crema) so you should request dairy-free versions explicitly.

### Nut-free

This is more challenging. Because some smoothies (e.g. “Chocolate Peanut Butter & Banana”) and dishes include nut milks or nut ingredients (almond milk, nut butters), you’ll need to check individually. The menu also mentions “shaved toasted almonds” on the coconut French toast. So for a nut allergy, you’ll need to explicitly request removal of nut ingredients and verify cross-contact.

### Keto

Because Truth & Tonic leans toward plant-based and carb-forward preparations (toasts, wraps, grains, fruits), there are limited truly keto-friendly options. You might be able to cobble together a low-carb plate (e.g. greens, avocado, certain protein additions). But I did not find clear keto-specific offerings on the menu.

### Paleo

Similarly, paleo (i.e. no grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar) is not a natural fit for many café items here. Some menu items (e.g. certain salads without grains, dressings, clean proteins) might be adaptable, but the default menu is not strongly paleo-oriented.

### Whole30

Because Whole30 is stricter (no dairy, no grains, no legumes, no added sugars, no processed oils), this also doesn’t seem to be a primary design constraint. Some items might be modifiable, but I did not see explicit Whole30-labeled dishes.

### Pescatarian

Truth & Tonic does allow animal protein options (e.g. smoked salmon avocado toast) in addition to its vegan offerings. So pescatarians should find some viable choices (especially around toasts or salads with fish). But much of their core menu is plant-based.

### Vegan

This is Truth & Tonic’s strength. The café positions itself as “the first fully vegan restaurant on the Strip” in some materials. Their menu is built around vegan versions of classic breakfast and lunch items (e.g. Just Egg substitutes, tofu scramble, plant-based “chicken”), and many dishes are already vegan or can be veganized. They also state that their vegan dishes are prepared with care and free from cross-contamination.

Reviewers frequently mention being able to order vegan family members to their satisfaction.

### Kosher

I did not find evidence that Truth & Tonic is certified kosher or explicitly caters to kosher dietary laws (e.g. separate meat/dairy, kosher supervision). Unless you confirm with the restaurant, I would not assume full kosher compliance.

### Halal

Likewise, I did not see any indication of halal certification or halal-specific menu labeling. Because much of the menu is vegan or plant-based, many dishes would inherently be halal-friendly (no pork, no alcohol in food). But without a formal halal guarantee or supervision, strict halal observers should inquire.

## Summary

Truth & Tonic is a hidden gem for health-focused diners on the Las Vegas Strip, especially those seeking vegan, plant-forward, or cleaner eating choices during brunch or lunch. Its wellness-forward mission, creative flavor combinations, and menu transparency are strong pluses for many dietary restrictions—provided you communicate your allergy or diet clearly to staff.
