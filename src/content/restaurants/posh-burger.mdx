There’s a certain kind of confidence required to open a gourmet burger counter inside one of the most competitive dining corridors in America, and Posh Burger delivers on that confidence with unapologetic indulgence. Located inside the sleek and modern ARIA Resort & Casino on the iconic Las Vegas Strip, this upscale fast-casual concept elevates the classic American burger into something worthy of its luxury surroundings.

Posh Burger blends premium ingredients, like Wagyu beef, brioche buns, and chef-driven toppings, with the speed and accessibility of a counter-service restaurant. Despite its decadent reputation, it’s surprisingly accommodating to guests with dietary restrictions, especially those navigating gluten-free, dairy-free, keto, and vegan lifestyles.

The ordering process is straightforward, and staff are generally knowledgeable about modifications, which is crucial for guests managing allergies or strict dietary protocols.

## My Experience

When I ate at Posh Burger, I splurged and ordered the Wagyu burger as a lettuce wrap with bacon and fries.

The order kiosk allows you to customize your order the way you want and has a dedicated section for allergies and food preferences. The chef even came out to confirm what I had ordered to make sure he prioritized my allergies and preferences.

The burger itself was perfectly cooked, spiced, and very satisfying! I focused on eating the burger, so I wasn't able to finish the generous portion of fries.

At $65 (as of December 2025), this wasn't a cheap burger joint, but it's one of the best burgers I've ever eaten!

## Dietary and Allergy Accommodations

### Gluten-Free

Posh Burger is considered a solid gluten-free option among Vegas burger spots, with positive mentions on Find Me Gluten Free. They offer gluten-free buns upon request, and guests can also opt for lettuce wraps for an even lower cross-contact risk.

The fries are naturally gluten-free by ingredient, but guests with celiac disease should confirm fryer practices, as shared fryers are common in burger restaurants.

### Dairy-Free

Dairy-free diners will find this restaurant very manageable. Most burgers can be customized without cheese or butter, and lettuce wraps make things even safer.

Be cautious with specialty sauces and milkshakes, which often contain dairy.

### Nut-Free

Posh Burger’s menu is generally friendly for nut-free diners. Burgers, beef, buns, and fries typically do not contain nuts. However, cross-contact is always possible, especially with desserts or specialty shakes.

Staff are usually able to confirm ingredient safety upon request.

### Keto

This is an excellent spot for keto diners. Nearly every burger can be converted into a keto-friendly meal simply by removing the bun.

Avoid fries and milkshakes due to high carbohydrate content.

### Paleo

Paleo dining is possible with careful customization. Choose lettuce-wrapped burgers and avoid cheese, processed sauces, and buns.

**Best paleo approach:**
- Lettuce-wrapped beef burger
- Add compliant toppings like onion, tomato, and avocado
- Skip fries and most sauces

### Whole30

Strict Whole30 compliance is challenging here due to sugar in sauces, bun ingredients, and cooking oils used for fries. However, a plain lettuce-wrapped beef patty with compliant toppings may work if you avoid sauces entirely.

This requires careful ordering and confirmation with staff.

### Pescatarian

There is only one seafood-based option, the Mahi Mahi sandwich. If its as good as the burgers, you'll enjoy it! Pescatarian's may find the Vegan options below appetizing as well.

### Vegan

Posh Burger earns strong marks from vegan reviewers on HappyCow thanks to its Impossible burger offering.

This makes it a satisfying vegan option in an otherwise meat-centric environment.

## Unmet Diets or Allergies

Some diets and allergies are not directly accommodated

### Kosher

No kosher certification or separation of meat and dairy

### Halal

No halal-certified proteins or preparation areas
