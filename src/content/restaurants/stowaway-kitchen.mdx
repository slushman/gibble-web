Opened in 2015, Stowaway Kitchenâ€™s co-owners wanted a diverse menu inspired by their travels abroad.

Focused more on brunch, the menu features  atypical brunch dishes including spiced kabocha + pecan waffle, black rice porridge, and oyako-don alongside salads, sandwiches, and several seafood dishes like oysters with chili hummus and grilled salmon.

For gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan diners, many dishes are clearly labeled on the menu with their respective allergens. Make sure to let the server know about any allergies.

Reviewers rave about:
* Smoked trout salad
* Scram breakfast sandwich

Many rave particularly about the Colorful Colorado, which is a smashed baked potato topped with poached eggs, ham, and veggies.

Stowaway Kitchen is located on Walnut Street in RiNo district of Denver, just a few blocks away from Coors Field.
