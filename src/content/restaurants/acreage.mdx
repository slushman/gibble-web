Opened in 2018, Acreage is a cider house, restaurant, and production facility for Stem Ciders.

The drinks menu at Acreage features all the flavors from stem ciders, including exclusive special releases.

For gluten-free diners, gluten-free dishes are clearly marked on the menu. Gluten-free options are available for other dishes at an additional charge.

For nut-free diners, dishes containing nuts are clearly marked on the menu.

For dairy-free diners, dishes using cheese are presumably dairy-free when ordering without it, but ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there are beyond meat burger patties available in addition to salads, and several veggie dishes like ratatoullie, patatas bravas, and crispy Brussels sprouts.

Reviewers rave about:
* Dedicated gluten-free fryer
* All the cider flavors
* Apple cider donuts
* Gluten-free burger

Acreage is located on Horizon Avenue in Lafayette.
