Opened in 1998, City O’ City has an eclectic vegetarian menu and the restaurant supports local vendors, products, and artists. 

The menu at City O’ City features soups, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, small and large entrees, and a wide selection of desserts.

For gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, nut-free, and vegan diners, the menu marks items that are or can be made one of those options. Be sure to tell your server about any allergies so they can help you order.

Many reviewers mention this may not be a great restaurant for celiacs though and that they do not have a separate gluten-free fryer.
