Opened in 2018, Hoja originated as the food truck Basecamp Provisions and has a calming garden cafe vibe. Most dishes are vegetarian and can be made vegan, if they are not already.

The menu at Hoja features breakfast burritos and lunch tacos.

For gluten-free diners, menu options are clearly marked, but ask if non-marked items can be made gluten-free.

For dairy-free diners, there many dishes that are vegan already. Presumably removing cheese would make dishes dairy-free, but ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there is the El Beso Del Chorizo vegan burrito and the any of the egg-based dishes can substitute a tofu scramble instead.

Reviewers rave about:
* Gluten-free Tahini brownies
* Gluten-free oat-based horchata
* Guava mimosa
* Farmers burrito
* Chilaquiles

Hoja is located on South Pearl Street in Platt Park.
