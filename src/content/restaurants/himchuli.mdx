Opened in 2016 by Khagendra “KG” Gurung, the owner of cuisine of the highlands in Evergreen, Colorado, Himchuli is a bright, modern eatery offering authentic, staple dishes of India and Nepal.

For gluten-free diners, there are over 20 options including Chana Masala, Daal Makhini, Aloo Gobi, and Aloo Saag.

For dairy-free, vegan, and vegetarian diners, there are over 15 vegan options including spinach or onion Pakoras, Baigan Bharta, Bhindi Masala, and Matar Paneer.

Reviewers rave about:
* Sweet potato masala
* Veggie samosas
* Paratha
* Scratch-made naan
* Rice pudding
* Chicken tiki masala

Many reviewers seem to prefer the RiNo location, which has a slightly different menu than the Highlands location.

Himchuli has two locations, the original on West 32nd in the Highlands neighborhood and the second at 35th and Larimer in the RiNo Arts District.
