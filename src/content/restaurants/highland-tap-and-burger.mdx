Opened in 2010, Highland Tap & Burger serves local beer, gourmet burgers, and other modern bar food.

The drinks menu at Highland Tap & Burger features wine, cocktails, seltzers, and beers from local breweries, including [Holidaily Brewing](/restaurants/denver/holidaily-brewing).

For gluten-free diners, reviewers are mixed about a dedicated fryer, so ask at the restaurant. Gluten-free items are clearly marked on the menu.

For dairy-free diners, removing cheese should make dishes dairy-free, but ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, they have a black bean patty or Impossible patty for burgers, cauliflower wings, and salads.

Reviewers rave about:
* Grilled chicken nacho burger
* Tater tots
* Chicken empanadas

Highland Tap & Burger has four locations, the original in Highlands, one in Sloanâ€™s Lake, one at Belleview Station in Greenwood Village, and one in Westminster.
