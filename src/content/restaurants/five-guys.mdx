Five Guys is a fast-food burger restaurant that was founded in 1986 in Arlington, Virginia. Known for their made-to-order burgers, hot dogs, and grilled cheese sandwiches, Five Guys has grown to become one of the most popular fast-food chains in the United States. Letâ€™s start exploring their allergen-friendly menu items by looking at the gluten-free options.

Five Guys offers gluten-free buns for their burgers, as well as hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches. And for a delicious gluten-free side, try their fresh-cut fries cooked in 100% peanut oil.

For those avoiding dairy, Five Guys offers a variety of toppings for their burgers and sandwiches, including lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, and more.

For those following a keto or whole 30 diet, Five Guys offers options such as burgers and sandwiches made with lettuce instead of a bun.

For those following a paleo diet, Five Guys offers options such as burgers made with lettuce instead of a bun and served with fresh veggies like lettuce, tomato, and pickles.

For diners with a peanut allergy, Five Guys is probably not the burger place for you. Five Guys used to be known for peanut shells all over the floor, and while they still have the peanuts, they ask diners not to toss them on the floor and they are given out by request only. That said, they still have peanuts and and fry everything in peanut oil. Their menu does not include any other kind of nuts.

Unfortunately, Five Guys does not offer any vegan, pescatarian, kosher, or halal options at this time.

We hope this helps you navigate the allergen-friendly options available at Five Guys. Remember to always check with the restaurant for the most up-to-date information and ingredient list.
