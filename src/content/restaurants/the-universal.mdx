Opened in 2012, The Universal features a Southern-style comfort food menu, including many breakfast standards like eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, biscuits, and grits.

For gluten-free diners, the pancakes can be made gluten-free and many other dishes appear to already be gluten-free. It is not an exclusively gluten-free kitchen, but they appear knowledgeable about food allergies and make an effort to avoid contamination.

For dairy-free diners, many breakfast dishes are or can be made dairy-free by removing the cheese, but ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, many dishes are marked as having a vegetarian option. The Bahn Mi and U Veg sandwiches are specifically vegetarian and vegan on request.

Reviewers rave about:
* Cornbread rancheros
* House-smoked pulled pork sandwich
* Homemade biscuits and preserves

The Universal can be found in Sunnyside, near Federal and 38th.
