Opened in 2014, Stem Ciders Taproom is a welcoming bar and brewpub offering handcrafted hard ciders and live music venue in rustic surroundings.

The drinks menu at Stem Ciders Taproom features their entire line of hard ciders brewed in Lafayette. They also carry cocktails, beer, and wine.

For gluten-free diners, they have quite a few options for food, including all the main entrees, soups, salads, most of the appetizers, and two of the three desserts.

For dairy-free diners, many dishes include cheese, but may be dairy-free by removing it. Ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there are salads, two sandwiches, Beyond Meat patties for burgers, and the vegetarian chorizo flautas.

Reviewers rave about:
* All the flavors of hard ciders
* Gluten-free cider donuts

Stem Ciders Taproom is located on Blake Street in the RiNo Arts District.
