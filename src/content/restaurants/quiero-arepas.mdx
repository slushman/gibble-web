Opened in 2010, Quiero Arepas is a 100% gluten-free restaurant that serves arepas, a Venezuelan staple dish. The arepa is a corn based flatbread that dates back to the Timoto Cuica tribe in Venezuela. Made of corn meal, water, and salt the arepa is grilled and baked then split and stuffed with a variety of ingredients.

For dairy-free diners, ordering arepas or sides without the cheese presumably makes them dairy-free. But ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there is the La Original vegan arepa. Leaving the cheese off the plantations should make them dairy-free and vegan.

Reviewers rave about:
* Pollo guisado
* Queso
* Reina pepiada
* Pabellon arepas

Quiero Arepas has two locations in Denver, one on South Pearl Street and the other in Avanti on North Pecos Street.
