Opened in 1999 in Boulder, Hapa Sushi Grill & Sake Bar blends sushi, Asian, and Hawaiian flavors.

For gluten-free diners, Hapa has an entire gluten-free menu including sushi, poke, salads, sashimi, and bowls.

For dairy-free diners, it appears most items are dairy-free, but ask the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there are thirteen vegetarian rolls, including five that are also gluten-free.

Reviewers rave about:
* Scottyâ€™s salmon roll
* Spicy tuna Hapa roll
* Fried taro
* White tuna roll
* Miso soup
* Shrimp tempura roll
* Spider roll.

Hapa Sushi Grill & Sake Bar has four locations, the original on Pearl Street in Boulder, on East Second Avenue in Cherry Creek, in the Landmark Retail Center in Greenwood Village, and on Blake Street in the LoDo neighborhood.
