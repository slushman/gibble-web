Opened in 1999, Panzano offers contemporary Northern Italian cuisine with a focus on local, seasonal, and organic ingredients. Panzano has been awarded 4 diamonds by AAA and named one of Zagat’s best restaurants in America.

For gluten-free diners, there is a separate, comprehensive, gluten-free menu with pasta, salads, antipasti, meat-based entrees, and sides. Reviewers say it’s a great place for celiacs.

For vegan and dairy-free diners, it appears many dishes have cheese, cream, or butter, so you may call ahead about options.

For vegetarian diners, there are several veggie-based pasta dishes including Melanzane, funghi pizza, Cavolini di Bruxelles, and Ravioli di Robiola.

Reviewers rave about:
* Fresh baked bread
* Brussels sprouts
* Gluten-free fettuccine with shrimp
* Pizza
* Butterscotch pudding

Panzano is located in the Kimpton Hotel Monaco on 17th Street in Denver.
