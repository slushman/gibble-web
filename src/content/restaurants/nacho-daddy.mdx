## Dietary and Allergy Accommodations

### Gluten-Free

Nacho Daddy offers multiple menu items labeled *gluten-free*, such as:

- Fiesta Nachos

Some diners report that certain locations use a **dedicated fryer** during specific times to reduce cross-contamination risk. While many celiac and gluten-sensitive diners have safely eaten here, Nacho Daddy notes that items **cannot be guaranteed 100% gluten-free** due to shared kitchen space.

**Tip:** Always inform your server and request use of the separate fryer or clean prep area.

### Dairy-Free

Most of Nacho Daddy’s **vegan items** are naturally dairy-free. The restaurant offers vegan cheese, sour cream, and queso as substitutes on many dishes. These options allow for a wide range of dairy-free nachos, tacos, and enchiladas.

As with other allergens, cross-contact is possible, so sensitive diners should notify staff before ordering.

### Pescatarian

- Shrimp fajitas

- Ceviche

These dishes make Nacho Daddy a solid choice for pescatarians seeking variety on the Strip.

## Unmet Diets or Allergies

Some diets and allergies are not directly accommodated

### Nut-Free

Nacho Daddy does not advertise itself as a nut-free restaurant. While nuts are not a major component of their dishes, peanuts and tree nuts may be present in the kitchen. Guests with nut allergies should exercise caution and speak directly with the manager.

### Keto

There’s no official keto menu, but keto diners can customize their orders. For example:
- Fajitas without tortillas, beans, or rice
- Protein-forward dishes with extra veggies

Sauces and dressings may contain sugar or starch, so confirm ingredients before ordering.

### Paleo

The menu is not designed for paleo diets, but some dishes — like fajitas with grilled meats and vegetables — can be adapted by omitting dairy, grains, and beans. Paleo guests will find limited direct options.

### Whole30

Nacho Daddy does not advertise any Whole30-compliant menu items. While proteins like grilled shrimp or steak may be close, the use of non-compliant oils, sauces, and seasonings means Whole30 diners will need to ask for heavy modifications.

### Kosher

No kosher certification or separation of meat and dairy

### Halal

No halal-certified proteins or preparation areas
