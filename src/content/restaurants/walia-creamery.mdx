Opened in 2019, Walia Creamery is a family-owned and operated shop that makes ice cream, sorbet, and vegan ice cream in small batches with quality ingredients.

For gluten-free diners, ice creams containing gluten are clearly marked, but most of are already gluten-free.

For dairy-free and vegan diners, they have a roster of at least nine vegan ice creams, many based on coconut milk, and three sorbets.

Reviewers rave about the gluten-free waffle cone and the flavors:
* Vegan chai
* Vegan chocolate
* Lavender
* Carrot cake
* Gluten-free birthday cake
* Vegan apple pie
* Earl gray
* Vegan sweet potato

Interestingly, they also sell tasty, savory, vegan Ethiopian food, according to reviewers.

Walia Creamery is located on Syracuse Street just north of the Lowry neighborhood.
