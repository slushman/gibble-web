Dunkin' Donuts is a well-known and beloved coffee and baked goods chain that has been serving customers since 1950. Whether you're in need of a quick breakfast or a midday pick-me-up, Dunkin' Donuts is a great choice.

At Dunkin' Donuts, customers with dietary restrictions can enjoy a range of allergen-friendly options. Let’s start by looking at the gluten-free options.

For those on a gluten-free diet, sadly none of the donuts are gluten-free. However, ordering any of the breakfast sandwiches without the bread should make them gluten-free, but ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For Celiacs, there’s little chance of avoiding cross-contamination.

For those avoiding dairy, there are non-dairy creamers available for coffee and tea, as well as alternative milk options like almond and oat milk. All of the donuts uses milk in the batter, but ordering the breakfast sandwiches without cheese should make them dairy-free.

For those with nut allergies, Dunkin' Donuts takes food allergies seriously and has strict protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination. Most of the donuts do not contain nuts, but ask at the counter about which ones are nut-free.

For those following a paleo, keto, or the Whole30 diet, Dunkin' Donuts offers a variety of options, such as black coffee, unsweetened iced tea, and egg and meat-based breakfast sandwiches without added sugars or preservatives.

For vegans, Dunkin' Donuts offers non-dairy creamers and alternative milk options like almond and oat milk. There are also food options like oatmeal, bagels, and hash browns. Sadly, there are no vegan donuts.

There are some Dunkin' Donuts that are kosher, or at least have some limited kosher options. Each franchise is responsible for being certified, so contact your local store to confirm.

Dunkin’ Donuts does not currently offer options for halal or pescatarian diners.

At Dunkin' Donuts, many customers with dietary restrictions can find allergen-friendly options. With non-dairy creamers and alternative milk options, Dunkin' Donuts has drink options for everyone. Hopefully someday, they will produce allergen-friendly donuts too.
