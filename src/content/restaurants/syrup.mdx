Opened in 2010, Syrup focuses on creating a bustling morning place that has an easy afternoon vibe. With the name Syrup, of course, the menu features most breakfast staples you can top with syrup: pancakes, waffles, and French toast. It’s also known for homemade syrups, flavored butters, and other creative toppings.

For gluten-free diners, the pancakes and waffles can be made gluten-free.

For dairy-free diners, like many breakfast dishes, ordering without cheese should make dishes dairy-free, but ask the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there’s a vegan egg substitute available for egg dishes and a veggie breakfast bowl.

Besides the syrup-topped breakfast items, reviewers rave about:
* Their award-winning corned beef hash
* Omelets
* Eggs Benedicts

Syrup has five locations, the original location in Cherry Creek, City Park, Edgewater, Capital Hill, and Downtown.
