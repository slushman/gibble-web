Started in 2018, Whole Sol Blend Bar blends up next-level smoothie bowls harnessing the power of superfoods.

The menu at Whole Sol Blend Bar is entirely gluten and dairy-free. Reviewers say the staff is well-trained and educated about food allergies. 

For gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegetarian diners, everything on the menu should be safe to order without modifications.

For vegan diners, there are several vegan-specific options and many of the dishes may be modified to be vegan.

Reviewers rave about:
* Peanut butter and chai jam toast
* Primal hot bowl
* Breakfast sandwich
* Chickpea frittata
* Matcha smoothie bowl

Whole Sol Blend Bar has eight locations, the original in LoDo/Union Station, RiNo, Sloanâ€™s Lake, Tabor Center, as well as locations in Longmont, Fort Collins, and two in Boulder.
