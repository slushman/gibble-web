Opened in 2015, Four Friends Kitchen is a Southern-inspired, contemporary American comfort food restaurant for breakfast, lunch, and weekend brunch.

The menu features many southern breakfast standards alongside unique dishes like smoked brisket hash and eggs and the creole shrimp omelet.

For gluten-free diners, many items appear to have a gluten-free option or can substitute gluten-free bread.

For dairy-free diners, dishes with cheese may be dairy-free by removing the cheese, but ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, they have an entirely separate menu of vegetarian and plant-based dishes. Some items are also marked as gluten-free or as having a gluten-free option. These items are vegetarian, not vegan, so they still use dairy cheese.

Reviewers rave about:
* Huevos rancheros
* Four friends grits
* Pancakes

Four Friends Kitchen is located on Roslyn Street, near Founders Green east of downtown Denver.
