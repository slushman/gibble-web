Opened in 2014 by the owners of the Brothers BBQ restaurants, Nuggs is a family-owned ice cream and dessert shop with seasonal flavors, nostalgic styling, and patio seating.

Nuggs has entire ice cream flavor menus for dairy-free, egg-free, soy-free, nut-free, and gluten-free diners. Check their website to see which flavors are available for your allergies.

Besides scoops and cones of ice cream, they also have banana splits, ice cream sandwiches, ice cream waffle tacos, milkshakes, malts, root beer floats, sundaes, and affogatos. It appears you can use any of their ice creams for these desserts.

Reviewers rave about the generous serving sizes and the flavors:
* Strawberry with golden Oreos mixed in
* Double stuffed cookies and cream
* Toasted coconut
* Mint chip
* Cookie dough
* Naimanâ€™s dark chocolate and cherry milkshake.

Nuggs is located on East Colfax Avenue in South Park Hill.
