Opened in 2016, Meta Burger is a plant-based, fast-casual restaurant specializing in innovative burgers, sandwiches and desserts with a retro diner vibe.

The burgers at Meta Burger are made from non-GMO soybeans and contain less fat and calories than competitors.

For gluten-free diners, all the sandwiches can be ordered as a lettuce wrap and there is a dedicated gluten-free fryer.

For dairy-free diners, it’s unclear if they use real cheese and they do not list ingredients for the shakes, so ask at the restaurant to be sure if they are dairy-free.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, the “meats” for each sandwich are all plant-based.

Reviewers rave about:
* Buffalo faux-chicken burger
* Sweet potato fries
* Chocolate mint milkshake

Meta Burger has three locations, the original on East Mississippi Avenue in Aurora, on 29th Avenue in Edgewater, and 29th Street in Boulder.
