Opened in 2014, Cheluna Brewing is a funky brewery inside an old aviation plant turned marketplace, pouring Latin and European style chelas, or beers.

The drinks menu at Cheluna Brewing features gluten-reduced beers, both seasonal and their flagship chelas.

For gluten-free drinkers, all the beers are gluten reduced, not gluten-free, except the Cheluna Colada IPA.

For diners, it does not appear that Cheluna serves its own food, but there are other vendors in Stanley marketplace and you’re welcome to bring in your food.

Reviewers rave about:
* Lowrider 2, which is an amber Mexican lager
* Chilango
* IPA
* ESB
* Salted caramel and coco blend

Cheluna Brewing is located on Dallas Street in Stanley Marketplace in Aurora.
