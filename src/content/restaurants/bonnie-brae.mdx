Opened in 1986, Bonnie Brae Ice Cream is an old-fashioned, family-owned, neighborhood creamery with an inventive roster of flavors that has become a Denver institution.

For gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan diners, they usually have a few options available every day and list them on their site and in-store. They also note any additional allergens present in these options.

Reviewers mention they have a gluten-free cone and most of their ice cream is already gluten-free and that the servers will take extra precautions upon request.

Reviewers rave about the generous portions and the flavors:
* Oreo
* Triple death chocolate
* Malted milk ball
* Oreos and cream
* Butterfinger
* Peppermint
* The combination of lemons sherbet and grand mariners
* Peach pie.

Bonnie Brae Ice Cream is located on South University Boulevard in Bonnie Brae.
