Opened in 2012 as an Italian deli, DiFranco’s also serves Italian cuisine, including freshly made pasta.

The menu at DiFranco’s features many Italian standards like spaghetti, vodka penne, fettuccine Alfredo, chicken Parmesan, meatballs, and garlic bread.

For gluten-free diners, the subs and pasta dishes all have a gluten-free option.

For dairy-free diners, ordering dishes without cheese may make them dairy-free, ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, they offer meatballs with an Impossible plant-based protein option, roasted eggplant dishes and subs, salads, and any pasta dish without the cheese and meat sauces should work, although ask at the restaurant to be sure.

Reviewers rave about:
* Gluten-free pasta with meatballs
* Garlic bread
* Gluten-free cannoli

DiFranco’s is located on Lincoln Street in Denver’s historic Golden Triangle District.
