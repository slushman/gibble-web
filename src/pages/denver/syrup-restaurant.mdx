Syrup opened in 2010 with a focus on creating a bustling morning place that has an easy afternoon vibe. With the name syrup, of course, the menu features pancakes, waffles, and French toast with homemade syrups, flavored butters, and other toppings.

The menu continues with breakfast staples like their award-winning corned beef hash, omelets, and eggs Benedicts. With two pages of breakfast items, you’re bound to find something you would like. Coffees, teas, juices, and a wide selection of breakfast cocktails cover the drinks.

Pancakes and waffles can be made gluten free and there’s a vegan egg substitute available for egg dishes. There’s also a veggie breakfast bowl.

Syrup has five locations, the original in cherry park, city park, edgewater, cap hill, and the downtown location seen in this video.
