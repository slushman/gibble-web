After running a coffee shop in Sante Fe, Colorado natives Michael and Desiree Keens decided to open a community-centered cafe that operates on the motto "love above all else." As they say, "...in a world filled with so much turmoil, we strive to create a place of rest, peace and sanctuary." The kitchen would be completely gluten-free, inspired by Desiree’s former restricted diet, but wouldn’t advertise themselves as such and ingredients would be locally sourced.

In 2017, they opened Rivers and Roads Coffee and a second smaller, grab-n-go location in 2022. Reviewers often comment that Rivers and Roads Coffee is the best place to get breakfast. Many referenced the breakfast fries, sausage breakfast sandwich, and the biscuits. The restaurant is, of course, also known for it's small-batch, in-house roasted coffee. If you want a latte or any other beverage made with milk, they have alternative milks available and made-from-scratch syrups and flavorings.

In addition to breakfast and coffee, Rivers and Roads has gluten-free bakery items. Their lunchtime menu includes sandwiches and salads. The restaurant seems to be very knowledgable about food allergens and many menu items note if they are also dairy-free or contain oats. It appears that many of the dishes containing dairy could be made without cheese, presumably making them dairy-free.

There are many vegan and vegetarian items as well. Some items are available on a regular basis and others appear on the menu when in-season.

As an added bonus, they also sell their small-batch, in-house roasted coffee beans and a few of their baking items as dry mixes so you can relive your visit at home.
