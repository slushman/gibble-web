Chick-fil-A is a fast food restaurant specializing in chicken sandwiches, salads, nuggets, and sides. Founded in the mid-1960s in Atlanta, Georgia, Chick-fil-A has since grown to become one of the largest quick-service chicken chains in the world. Chick-fil-A has options for many diets and like their famous customer service, they take food allergies and dietary restrictions seriously when informed. Letâ€™s start by exploring the gluten-free options.

Chick-fil-A offers a variety of gluten-free options, including their grilled chicken sandwich served on a gluten-free bun. They also have gluten-free salads, wraps, and sides such as waffle potato fries.

For those avoiding dairy, Chick-fil-A offers a dairy-free dipping sauce made with a blend of herbs, spices, and a hint of lemon. And for a delicious dairy-free option, try their grilled chicken nuggets.

For those avoiding nuts, Chick-fil-A uses peanut oil for all their fried items. According to their frequently asked questions, the oil is refined, bleached, and deodorized, which means the proteins in the oil are stripped out during processing. According to the FDA, that makes the peanut oil no longer a major allergen. However, follow the advice of your healthcare provider for you dietary restrictions,

Chick-fil-A has options for those following a keto or whole 30 diet, including grilled chicken nuggets, salads, and wraps made with lettuce instead of a bun. They also have a variety of low-carb sides like their superfood side, which includes kale and broccolini.

For those following a paleo diet, in addition to the options above for keto and whole 30 dieters, Chick-fil-A offers their grilled market salad, made with mixed greens, grilled chicken, and a variety of fresh veggies. These options are free from grains, legumes, and dairy, making them a great choice for those following a paleo lifestyle.

Some Chick-fil-A locations do not serve any breaded items during the Passover holiday, so at least for that time, at certain locations, it is considered kosher for Passover. However, outside of Passover season and at those locations, it is not considered kosher.

Unfortunately, Chick-fil-A does not offer vegetarian, pescatarian, vegan or halal options at this time.
