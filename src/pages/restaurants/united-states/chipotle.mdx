Chipotle is a popular restaurant chain known for its delicious burritos, bowls, and tacos, but did you know that they also offer a variety of options for those with food allergies or dietary restrictions? Let's take a closer look.

First, let's talk about Chipotle's allergen statement. They have a comprehensive guide on their website that lists all of the ingredients they use and any potential allergens that may be present in their dishes. The guide shows which foods contain gluten, dairy, soy, and sulfites. There is also a guide for special diets like vegan, vegetarian, keto, paleo, and Whole30. This makes it easy for customers to make informed decisions about what to order.

Next, we have the option of ordering a burrito, bowl or a taco in a lettuce wrap instead of a tortilla or a bowl. This is a great option for those who are gluten-free.

Chipotle also offers a variety of vegetarian and vegan options, including their Sofritas, which is a spicy, shredded tofu, their plant-based chorizo, and their black and pinto beans, which are both vegan.

In addition, Chipotle also has a variety of toppings and sides that are dairy-free, such as their fresh salsa and guacamole.

Chipotle offers a variety of options for those with nut allergies, as they do not use any peanuts or tree nuts in their dishes or in their kitchens.

For those following kosher or halal diets, Chipotle is neither kosher, nor halal. Halal diners mention sticking to vegetarian or vegan options and avoiding the meats altogether.

Finally, Chipotle states they do not use mustard, peanuts, tree nuts, sesame, shellfish, or fish as ingredients in their food. They also only use eggs in locations serving breakfast items. 

If you're following a specific diet such as paleo, keto, or Whole30, Chipotle has options for you as well. You can order a bowl with a base of lettuce, meat, and vegetables, and avoid the beans and rice, which are not paleo or Whole30 compliant. Additionally, Chipotle offers a variety of salsas and guacamole that can add flavor without adding unwanted carbs for those following a keto diet.

So, whether you're gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, paleo, keto, Whole30, or have an allergy to nuts, peanuts, shellfish, eggs, mustard, or sesame, Chipotle has options for you. Next time you're craving some delicious Mexican food, be sure to check out Chipotle and their allergen-friendly options.
