Opened in 2013, Federal Bar & Grill is a laid-back tavern with bar food, brunch, twenty draft beer lines, classic cocktails, and patio seating.

The drinks menu at Federal Bar & Grill features a rotating selection of draft beers, including gluten-free beers and ciders from local brewers [Holidaily Brewing](/restaurants/denver/holidaily-brewing) and [Stem Ciders](/restaurants/denver/stem-ciders-taproom).

For gluten-free diners, most of their menu can be modified to be gluten-free.

For dairy-free diners, dishes may be dairy-free by removing cheese, but ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, in addition to salads, they have Beyond Meat patties, the veg out sandwich, edamame, and breaded artichoke hearts.

Reviewers rave about:
* The gluten-safe food and dedicated fryer
* Gluten-free fish and chips
* Burgers

Federal Bar & Grill is located on Federal Boulevard in Jefferson Park.
