Opened in 2014, Wave the Grain began after owner Allyson Kulinskiâ€™s son was diagnosed with celiacs. Not finding many appetizing options in stores, she began making her own bakery items and selling them to the public.

Everything at Wave the Grain is 100% gluten-free. Many items have a dairy-free, vegan, and/or keto option as well. Each is clearly marked on the menu. Reviewers mention there are egg-free, soy-free, potato-free, and corn-free options so be sure to ask at the bakery.

The menu features breads, cakes, cupcakes, take and bake meals, pastries, and keto treats.

Reviewers rave about:
* Keto cheesecake
* Cinnamon streusel muffin
* Chocolate chip cookies

Wave the Grain has two locations, the original on South Holly Street in Centennial and the Littleton location on West Bowles Avenue.
