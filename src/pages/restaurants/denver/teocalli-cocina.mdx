Opened in 2019, Teocalli Cocina is a gluten-free authentic Mexican restaurant that uses corn in most dishes.

The menu at Teocalli Cocina features many Mexican staples plus dishes like De Birria, pescado, cotija, and pork shank pibil.

For gluten-free diners, most if not all dishes are gluten-free.

For dairy-free diners, many dishes contain cheese or butter, so ask at the restaurant if leaving off the cheese makes the dish dairy-free.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there are plenty of options like the hamachi cheviche, Brussels sprouts, fingerling potatoes, chopped salad, and sides like black beans and guacamole.

Reviewers rave about:
* Gluten-free churros
* Chicken quesdilla
* Cojita
* Carne asada
* Peanut salsa

Teocalli Cocina has two locations, one on the corner of Ralston and Wadsworth in Arvada, Colorado and one on Public Road in Lafayette, Colorado.
