Opened in 2011 in Boulder, Pizzeria Locale serves Neighborhood Neapolitan pizza. The dough is made fresh daily with only four ingredients and every crust is stretched by hand to make the perfect pizza.

For gluten-free diners, reviewers say there is high chance of cross contamination. There is a gluten-free crust available.

For dairy-free diners, there is a dairy-free cheese available.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there are tons of veggie toppings to choose from.
