Opened in 2001, Masalaa is a 100% vegetarian Indian restaurant. It is the first and only Indian restaurant in Colorado to receive the smart meal seal.

The menu at Masalaa features standard Indian fair like dosa, vada, uthappam, idly, and many vegetable-based entrees.

For gluten-free diners, there is an entire gluten-free menu with twenty items.

For dairy-free diners, it appears many dishes include dairy in some form. Reviewers mention you may want to call ahead to check on options.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, everything is vegetarian. Because of the use of dairy, ask at the restaurant which dishes are vegan.

Reviewers rave about:
* masala dosa
* savory Indian pancakes (uthapam)
* donuts (vada)
* behl puri
* all various flavors of dosa.

Masalaa is located at the intersection of South Parker Road and South Peoria street in Aurora.
