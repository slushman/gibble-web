Opened in 2009, Root Down combines locally sourced veggie-forward fare with a funky, mid-century decor in a retrofitted garage. While vegan-friendly, the meat-based dishes are still highly praised.

For gluten-free diners, most dishes are marked gluten-free like the Colorado lamb burger sliders, Devils on Horseback, or rockfish tom kha. Four of the six desserts are gluten-free.

For dairy-free and vegan diners, there are several dishes marked as vegan like veggie burger sliders, red rice risotto, or Harissa "rofu" ragine. The warm chocolate brownie and chocolate espresso truffle desserts are vegan.

Reviewers rave about:
* Pan-roasted chicken
* Cobb salad
* Veggie sliders
* Devils on Horseback
* Soyrizo queso
* Tofu scramble.

Root Down has two locations, the original on West 33rd Avenue in the Highlands area and a second in the Denver airport.
