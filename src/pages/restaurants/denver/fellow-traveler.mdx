Opened in 2022, Fellow Traveler features whole, vegetable-forward dishes that do not lean on meat substitutes made like your grandmother would have done.

The menu at Fellow Traveler features Mexican standards like tacos, burritos, and chilaquiles. There is also Bahn Mi, Aloo Gobi, salads, and the brunch menu adds waffles!

One of the co-owners, Joe Phillips, is a former bartender, so the drinks menu is extensive and includes some alcohol-free options.

For gluten-free diners, reviewers mention most of the menu is gluten-free or can be made so. 

For dairy-free, vegan, and vegetarian diners, everything is already dairy-free and vegan, enjoy!

Reviewers rave about:
* Bahn mi
* Darleneâ€™s Downeast chocolate cake
* Aloo Gobi
* Gluten-free deep south Broadway burrito
* Fried cornbread
* Herbed potato wedges

Fellow Traveler is located at South Broadway and West Hampden Avenue in Englewood.
