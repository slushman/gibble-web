Opened in 2010, Hops & Pie is a cozy pizzeria featuring unusual toppings, including myriad veggie options, and rotating craft brews. Berkeley donuts, which makes potato-style donuts, is in the same restaurant.

For gluten-free diners, reviewers had mixed reviews about whether cross-contamination is likely. There is a gluten-free crust available.

For dairy-free, vegan, and vegetarian diners, besides the wide array of veggie pizza toppings, there is Daiya vegan Cheese, House Made Vegan Sicilian Sausage (not gluten-free), Plant Based Pepperoni (not gluten-free), and House Smoked Tofu available.

For dessert, Berkeley donuts has both gluten-free and vegan donuts available.
