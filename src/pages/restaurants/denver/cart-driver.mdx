Opened in 2014, Cart-Driver is named after the Italian Carrettiera, or farm-to-table cart drivers of old. They serve antipasti, pizza, beers, wine, and cocktails.

For gluten-free diners, they have a gluten-free sourdough pizza crust, but they state there is a chance of cross-contamination.

For dairy-free diners, they have a vegan mozzarella for pizzas.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there two salads, three pizzas, and be-hive vegan sausage or pepperoni available.

For desserts, they have a vegan basque cheesecake and a gluten and dairy-free chocolate cake.

Reviewers rave about:
* The Cart Driver pizza with its apricot jalape√±o sauce
* Mushroom pizza
* White pizza
* The surprisingly great oysters appetizer
* Peppers pizza
* The Fall pizza with vegan sausage

Cart-Driver has two locations, the original on Larimer Street in the RiNo Arts District and the second in LoHi on West 30th Avenue.
