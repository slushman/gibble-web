Opened in 2009, Denver Pizza Company serves thin and deep-dish pizzas, plus wings, salads, and ice cream with a local, eco-conscious focus as Colorado’s first 100% wind-powered pizza company.

For gluten-free diners, reviewers say this the fluffiest gluten-free pizza crust they have ever had and the kitchen staff takes great precautions to avoid cross-contamination. 

For dairy-free diners, they have Daiya vegan cheese for pizzas.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, in addition to the Daiya vegan cheese, they also have loads of veggie pizza toppings and salads.

Reviewers rave about:
* Jalapeño popper sticks
* Cripple Creek pizza
* Chicken wings
* Barbecue pizza
* Magnificent Seven pizza
* Hot Spring pizza

Denver Pizza Company has three locations, the original in West 11th in the Golden Triangle, the second on Jersey Street in east Denver, and on West 38th avenue in Wheat Ridge.
