Opened in 2018, Super Mega Bien brings a fun and approachable menu that traverses the world of Latin American cuisine with a unique dining experience with “dim sum style” and family-style entrees meant for sharing among friends.

Super Mega Bien features an almost entirely gluten-free menu and they take allergies very seriously.

For dairy-free diners, many dishes are marked dairy-free. Presumably, removing cheese from dishes would make them dairy/free also, but be sure to ask.

For vegetarian diners, there are many dishes marked as vegetarian.

For nut-free diners, the Tarta De Santiago is the only item marked as containing nuts.

Reviewers rave about:
* Ceviche
* Mexican chocolate cheesecake
* Rice noodles with chipotle shrimp
* Chorizo and shrimp paella
* Plantains with pineapple sauce.

Super Mega Bien is located on 25th and Larimer in the Rambler Hotel a few blocks away from Coors Field.
