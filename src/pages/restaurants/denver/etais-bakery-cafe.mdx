Etai’s Bakery Cafe started in 2003 as Udi’s Cafe. After selling the Udi’s bread brand to Smart Balance, Udi’s cafes were renamed Etai’s Bakery Cafe.

The menu features brunch items like burritos, omelets, sandwiches, and salads.

For gluten-free diners, any dish with bread can use Udi’s gluten-free bread instead. All their sides, fries, soups, and falafel are already gluten-free. Dishes with tortillas can use gluten-free corn tortillas instead.

For dairy-free diners, many items are marked as vegan, therefore dairy-free already. Dishes with cheese may be dairy-free by removing the cheese, but ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan or vegetarian diners many dishes are marked as vegan already!

Reviewers rave about:
* French dip sandwich
* Rotisserie chicken salad
* Chicken shawarma pita

Etai’s Bakery Cafe has two locations: 29th Avenue and Broadway. There are also two sister restaurants, Izzio Central Market on Larimer Street and Etai’s Greenhouse on 17th Avenue in Aurora.
