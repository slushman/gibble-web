Opened in 2016, The Pig & The Sprout serves a playful menu that embodies the dual nature of their name; perfect for vegans and meat-eaters alike.

The all-day menu features a range of dishes like brunch burritos, tacos, appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, steaks, seafood entrees, and stir fry.

For gluten-free diners, many items are clearly marked as gluten-free; others can be made so, like substituting flour tortillas for corn.

For dairy-free, pescatarian, vegan, and vegetarian diners, “the sprout” half of the menu clearly marks the appropriate dishes and there are plenty of options to choose.

Reviewers rave about:
* French fries
* Brisket poutine
* Grilled cheese with tomato soup
* Chicken wings

The Pig & The Sprout is located on Chestnut Place in downtown Denver within walking distance of Coors Field and Union Station.
