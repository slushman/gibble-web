Opened in 2013 in Littleton by Minnesota natives Andrew Myhre and Steve Longman, Inside Scoop Creamery is a relaxed ice cream parlor serving twenty rotating flavors of homemade ice creams in handcrafted waffle cones.

For gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan diners, their site and reviewers state there are options, but donâ€™t list them other than in-store, so ask at the restaurant to see what options are available that day.

Reviewers rave about the generous portion sizes, the waffle cones, and the flavors:
* Oreo
* Butter pecan
* Minnesota salted toffee
* Java chocolate chip
* Lemon crunch
* Horchata
* Strawberry
* Chocolate chip cookie dough
* Cherry cobbler

Inside Scoop Creamery has two locations, the original on South Prince Street in Littleton and Platt Street in Highlands.
