Opened in 2015 by two Detroit natives Blue Pan Detroit Style Pizza is airy, casual pizzeria serving Italian specialties alongside Colorado-centric beer & cocktails.

For gluten-free diners, they have gluten-free versions of their Detroit-style and their classic Italian-style pizzas. The gluten-free flour they use from Wildflour Baking is also nut-free.

For dairy-free diners, they do have a dairy-free vegan cheese, but the Detroit-style crust still has whey protein in it.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, they have vegan cheese, pepperoni, and Italian crumbles.

Reviewers rave about:
* Gluten-free Detroit-style pizza crust
* Brooklyn Bridge pizza
* Prospector pizza
* Sweetie Pie pizza

A New Yorker even said the New York-style pizza was excellent!

Blue Pan Detroit Style Pizza has two locations, the original on West 32nd in West Highland and a second on East 12th in Congress Park.
