In 2017, Colorado natives Michael and Desiree Keens opened Rivers and Roads Coffee. Beyond its popular breakfast menu, they are also known for small-batch, in-house roasted coffee.

For gluten-free diners, this is a 100% gluten-free kitchen, but they donâ€™t really advertise it. This includes the bakery items!

For dairy-free diners, many dishes note if they are dairy-free. Ordering dishes without cheese should make them dairy-free, but ask at the restaurant to make sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there are many vegan and vegetarian items as well. Some items are available on a regular basis and others are seasonal.

Reviewers rave about:
* Breakfast fries
* Sausage breakfast sandwich
* Biscuits

Rivers and Roads Coffee has two locations, the original location on Bruce Randolph Avenue in City Park and a second, smaller location on Champa Street in Curtis Park.
