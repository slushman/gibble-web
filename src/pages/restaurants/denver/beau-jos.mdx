Opened in 1973 in Idaho Springs, Beau Jo’s is home to the famous Colorado mountain pie, known for its thick, braided crust made with honey instead of sugar.

For gluten-free diners, they do not have a dedicated oven or prep space, so cross contamination is likely. They do have gluten-free pizza crusts available and items that are not gluten-free are clearly marked.

For dairy-free, vegan, and vegetarian diners, there is a dairy-free mozzarella cheese, lots of veggie pizza toppings, and plant-based pepperoni and Italian sausage.

Reviewers rave about:
* Spinach and artichoke dip
* Chicken pesto pizza
* Cheesy garlic bread
* The magician and balloon artist to entertain the kids
* Vegan and gluten-free sausage pizza

Beau Jo’s has six locations, the original in Idaho Springs, Evergreen, Fort Collins, Steamboat Springs, and three Denver-area locations, two in Lone Tree and one in Arvada.
