Opened in 2008, Little Man Ice Cream serves unique flavors of homemade ice cream from their iconic 28-foot-tall cream can-shaped building in their original location. 

For gluten-free diners, they have gluten-free cones and use separate gloves and scoopers when informed of allergies. However, all flavors are made in the same kitchen, so there is still a chance cross-contamination.

For dairy-free and vegan diners, they have vegan ice creams available, check at the location for the latest available flavors.

Reviewers rave about the flavors:
* Vegan pumpkin chai
* Salted Oreo
* Banana pudding
* Vegan dark chocolate
* Vegan chocolate Oreo

Little Man Ice Cream family has six locations, the original in South Highlands, Old Town Churn in Fort Collins, The Constellation Ice Cream in North urora, Dang Soft Serve in Park Hill, Sweet Cooieâ€™s in Congress Park, and a pop-up location in Englewood.
