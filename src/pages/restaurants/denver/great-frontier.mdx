Opened in 2015, Great Frontier Brewing Company specializes in gluten-free and gluten-reduced beers, including one that won a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival.

For gluten-free diners, the flagship beers include one, the Blonde Annie, that is gluten-free, four that are gluten-reduced, and the others are traditional beers. They also have gluten-reduced seasonal beers as well.

There is no food menu available online, but older reviews mention food trucks. Be sure to inform your server about your allergies or dietary needs before ordering food or drinks.
