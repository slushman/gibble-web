Opened in 2018, Acova bears a vintage flair and contemporary charm and a Celiac-safe menu.

The menu at Acova features 40 gluten-safe dishes, ranging from soups, salads, sandwiches, and burgers to nicer entrees like short ribs, salmon, and pierogis.

For gluten-free diners, the entire menu should be safe since the ownerâ€™s son has Celiac disease and they wanted to create a gluten-safe restaurant.

For dairy-free diners, many dishes so still use dairy, so ask at the restaurant about safe dishes.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, at least one third of the menu is vegetarian or has a vegetarian option, including all the desserts.

Reviewers rave about:
* Gluten-free fish and chips
* Lobster Mac and cheese
* Pot roast hash
* Gluten-free biscuits
* Apple donuts
* Chocolate torte

Acova is located on Navajo Street in the Highlands neighborhood, northeast of downtown Denver.
