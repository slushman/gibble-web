Opened in 2016, Leroy’s Bagels has become a staple of the neighborhood and Denver’s food scene. They make, boil, and bake 16 favors of bagels and many toppings daily.

For gluten-free diners, Leroy’s is known for its gluten-free bagels.

For dairy-free diners, there are a multitude of dairy-free toppings for your bagel.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there’s a vegan chive spread to put on your bagel!

Besides breakfast bagels, they also have a wide selection of bagel sandwiches like the el Diablo with turkey, pepper jack, and jalapeños.

Reviewers rave about:
* Gluten-free bagels
* Scratch-made flavored cream cheeses

Reviewers also recommend ordering online for pickup since they can run out bagels and seats inside.

Aside from their location on 29th Avenue, you can get LeRoy’s Bagels at The Radiator Cafe and a new location planned on 19th Avenue.
