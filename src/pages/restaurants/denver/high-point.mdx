Opened in 2014, High Point Creamery is an ice cream parlor handcrafting sauces and ice cream in small batches of unique flavors.

For gluten-free diners, most of the ice creams are clearly marked as gluten-free.

For dairy-free and vegan diners, there is at least one flavor available, coconut crème brûlée, that is based on coconut milk.

Reviewers rave about the flavors:
* Salted caramel
* Vegan coconut crème brûlée
* The cookies and cream that uses three different flavors of cookie
* Brown sugar cinnamon
* Tin Cup whiskey and pistachio brittle
* Basil blackberry swirl

Reviewers also mention they have flights, so you can order multiple flavors!

High Point Creamery has three locations, the original on South Holly Street in Hilltop, one on Larimer Street in the RiNo Arts District, and one one Tennyson Street in Berkeley.
