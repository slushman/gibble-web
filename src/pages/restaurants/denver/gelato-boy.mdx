Started in 2018 in Boulder as Fior di Latte, Gelato Boy is a contemporary counter-serve gelateria serving house-made Italian gelato in classic and unique flavors.

For gluten-free diners, most of the gelatos and sorbets are already gluten-free. Each flavor has its own page on their site where you view the ingredients and nutrition information.

For dairy-free and vegan diners, they have an entire menu of dairy-free gelatos and sorbets.

Gelato Boy has four locations, two in Boulder and two in the Denver area, one at 9th and Colorado Boulevard in Congress Park and the other on 16th Street Mall in Downtown.
