Opened in 2015, onefold features a menu of mostly family recipes that blends Asian and Mexican flavors. 

Some of the unusual breakfast dishes are the savory rice porridge called congee filled with American breakfast staples, just like an omelet, and the Chinese sausage fried rice. 

For gluten-free diners, all of the breakfast dishes are listed as gluten-free.

For dairy-free diners, the breakfast tacos, burritos, or huevos rancheros can be made dairy-free. Other dishes may be dairy-free also, ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan or vegetarian diners, they fry items in olive oil when requested and they avoid GMO products, MSG, vegetable oils, and seed oils.

Reviewers rave about:
* The fried rice dishes
* Chilaquiles
* Duck fat fried eggs
* Vegetarian breakfast options

Onefold is located in the Uptown neighborhood, across the street from Saint Josephâ€™s Hospital.
