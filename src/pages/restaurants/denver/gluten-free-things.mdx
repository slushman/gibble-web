All products on the menu are gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free, corn-free, soy-free, nut-free, preservative-free, and vegan.

The menu at Gluten Free Things features a comprehensive list of bakery standards like English muffins, pitas, sandwich bread, buns, rolls, bagels, croutons, cookies, graham crackers, pizza crusts, cakes, cupcakes, and edible cookie dough. 

They also sell their own line of flour mixes, such as waffle and pancake, all purpose, baked goods, pizza crust, and pie crust.
