Opened in 2019, So Radish is an all-vegan 80â€™s themed restaurant started by husband and wife Scott and Lisa Spears.

The menu at So Radish features many traditionally meat-based dishes, but with a vegan spin. The menu was developed based on experience cooking for family members with food allergies. Interestingly, you can add meat to any dish.

For gluten-free diners, many dishes are clearly marked as gluten-free. Others have a gluten-free option. Reviewers mention they have a dedicated gluten-fryer for fried items and both of the desserts are gluten-free!

For dairy-free, vegan and vegetarian diners, everything is vegan and dairy-free, so enjoy!

Reviewers rave about:
* Fried avocado
* Spicy peanut tofu
* Kale pesto gnocchi
* Cauliflower tacos
* Bean burger
* Mac and cheese

So Radish is located on Olde Wadsworth Boulevard in Olde Town Arvada.
