Opened in 2008, Sexy Pizza serves hand-tossed, deck oven made from scratch with fresh ingredients and hand-cut veggies, making them a Denver favorite for more than a decade.

For gluten-free diners, reviewers say the gluten-free crust is delicious and they take precautions, but there is still a good chance of cross-contamination.

For dairy-free diners, vegan, and vegetarian diners, they have a highly recommended vegan cheese available and loads of veggie toppings.

Impressively for a local chain, they have their ingredients and allergens linked from the menu page for every dish.

Reviewers rave about:
* Vegetable pizza with vegan cheese
* Garlic Knots
* Sexy Sheikh pizza
* Calzones
* Buffalo chicken
* Ease of the online ordering system

Sexy Pizza has one location in Trinidad, Colorado, and four in the Denver area, Capital Hill, Old South Pearl, Jefferson Park, and Park Hill.
