Opened in 1982, The Delectable Egg is known as one of Denverâ€™s top breakfast restaurants. This self-proclaimed home of the Denver omelet has a mix of friendly atmosphere and fresh, all natural ingredients attracting locals and tourists alike.

For gluten and/or dairy-free diners, most dishes are egg-based and can be made gluten and/or dairy-free. 

For gluten-free diners, most dishes can include gluten-free bread or English muffin. The waffles and pancakes can be gluten-free, but not the French toast or crepes.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there is granola, yogurt, and fruit or oatmeal. Honestly, your options are pretty limited here.

Reviewers rave about:
* Waffles
* The Benedicts
* English breakfast tea
* Denver omelet
* The high-protein egg beaters option for any egg-based dish

The Delectable Egg has five Denver metro-area locations: Court Place, Market Street, Lowry Town Center, Westminster, and Greenwood Village.
