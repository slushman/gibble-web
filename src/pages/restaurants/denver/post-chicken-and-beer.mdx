Opened in 2014, The Post Chicken and Beer serves family-style comfort food and was featured by Guy Fieri on Food Network’s Diners Drive-Ins, & Dives.

For diners with special diets, many items, including the fried chicken, are clearly marked on the menu as gluten-free or vegetarian.

For other allergies, they may be able to modify dishes, please call ahead or ask at the restaurant.

Their drinks menu feature drinks by [Stem Ciders](/restaurants/denver/stem-ciders-taproom) and [Holidaily Brewing](/restaurants/denver/holidaily-brewing), both of which we’ll cover in our [gluten-free breweries video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM7Fjw6uJAA).

Reviewers rave about:
* Fried chicken
* Slaw
* Collard greens
* Biscuits
* Chocolate Whoopie pie

The Post Chicken and Beer has seven locations: the original in Lafayette, Longmont, Boulder, Estes Park, Fort Collins, and two Denver locations, one in Rosedale and the other in LoHi.
