Opened in 2015, Bar Dough Pizza is a modern, rustic Italian restaurant featuring gourmet wood-fired pizzas, pastas, wine, beer, and cocktails. It is owned by the same restaurateurs who own [Highland Tap and Burgers](/restaurants/denver/highland-tap-and-burger), which is featured in our [gluten-free breweries video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM7Fjw6uJAA).

For gluten-free diners, they have a gluten-free pizza crust and gluten-free pasta, but some reviewers seem concerned about cross-contamination, especially for celiacs.

For vegan and dairy-free diners, they do not list a vegan cheese being available, so you may want to call ahead to confirm.

For vegetarian diners, there are several pastas and pizzas that are vegetable-based, but still use dairy cheese.

Reviewers rave about:
* The chewy and smoky wood-fired crust
* Steak and egg sandwich
* Cacio e pepe
* Gluten-free magherita pizza
* Garlic bread

Bar Dough Pizza is located on West 32nd avenue in Highlands, just northeast of downtown Denver.
