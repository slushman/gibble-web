Opened in 2011 in the Capital Hill neighborhood of downtown Denver, Jelly features bright colors and retro decor. It has become known for its brunch menu, including breakfast cocktails.

The menu at Jelly Cafe feature donuts bites of many different flavors, including Mexican chocolate, salted caramel, and Thai peanut. There are also four flavors of pancakes.

For gluten-free diners, both the donut bites and pancakes can be ordered gluten-free. There are also gluten-free Benedictâ€™s, scrambles, and hashes. 

For dairy-free diners, many items that include cheese may be dairy-free by removing the cheese, but ask at the restaurant to be sure.

For vegan and vegetarian diners, there are vegetarian options including the veggie burrito, avocado toast, the veggie benedict, and the veggie biscuit.

* Pancakes
* Biscuits (not gluten-free)

Jelly Cafe has two locations, the original in Capital Hill and a second two blocks west of the University of Denver.
