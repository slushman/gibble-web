After baking macarons on the side while working in the dental industry, owner Heather Carpenter started baking full time in 2017. In 2022, she opened the Bella Macaron storefront and commercial kitchen.

The menu at Bella Macaron features 250 flavors of macarons. There are seasonal flavors, favorites for weddings, and everyoneâ€™s favorites such as birthday cake and lavender honey. They also have cinnamon rolls, eclairs, cookies, and other bakery standards.

For gluten-free diners, this is a 100% gluten-free kitchen!
