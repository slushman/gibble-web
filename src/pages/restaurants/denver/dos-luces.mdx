Opened in 2018, Dos Luces Brewery revives the gluten-free, corn-based brews Chicha, Tepache, and Pulque originating from the Incas and Aztecs.

The drinks menu at Dos Luces Brewery features all their own chicha, tepache, and pulque brews and a craft soda made with Peruvian purple corn. All the brews are gluten-free, except for a collaboration beer, which is noted on the menu.

Some reviewers mention they serve food, others mention bringing in your own food. No menu is available online, so ask at the brewery for food safe for your particular allergies or dietary needs.

Reviewers rave about each of the flavors of chicha, tepache, and pulque, like:
* Pineapple Tepache
* Blackberry pulque
* Agua Fresca dura
* Cornwine
* Mango Arbol Chile chicha
* Chicha morada
* Lime ancho Chile pulque

Dos Luces Brewery is located on South Broadway in Platt Park.
