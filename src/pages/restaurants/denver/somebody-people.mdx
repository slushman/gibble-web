Opened in 2019, Somebody People serves vegetable-forward dishes with a Mediterranean flavor.

The menu at Somebody People is planned out each week and rotates according to local suppliers. The standard dishes center around pastas or vegetables like cabbage, squash, or mushrooms. They have a special Sunday Supper each week where they serve a five course meal to every diner.

For gluten-free diners, the menu clearly marks gluten-free items.

For dairy-free diners and vegan diners, itâ€™s unclear if they use dairy or animal products, so be sure to ask at the restaurant.

For all allergies, be sure to let them know when ordering so they can help you order safely.

Reviewers rave about:
* Sourdough focaccia
* Chinese eggplant
* Delicata squash
* Farro and cannelini soup
* Black sesame chai ice cream

Somebody People is located on South Broadway in Platt Park.
