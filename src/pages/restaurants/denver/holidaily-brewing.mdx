Karen Hertz founded Holidaily Brewing in 2016 after surviving cancer. She switched to a gluten-free diet, but still wanted to enjoy beer with her friends. Today, the brewery in Golden is the largest fully gluten-free brewery in the United States.

For gluten-free drinkers, Holidaily is a 100% dedicated gluten-free brewer. They supply many bars and restaurants in Denver with their gluten-free beers, so you’ll find their brews all over.

They currently produce 8 different brews:
* Favorite blonde ale
* Fat Randy’s IPA
* Big Henry hazy IPA
* Riva stout
* Beulah red ale

They also produce seasonal brews such as:
* Buckwit Belgian
* Patchy waters pumpkin ale
* The rotating experimental adventure series

Holidaily Brewing has two locations, the original taproom and production facility in Golden and the Denver Tech Center location.
