In 2017, due to the popularity of their brews, Yak & Yeti Brewpub rebranded the beer side of their business to Spice Trade Brewing.

The drinks menu at Spice Trade Brewing features a wide variety of domestic-style classics and globally-inspired brews.

For all food orders, be sure to inform them of your allergies before ordering.

For gluten-free diners, all their beers are gluten-removed, not necessarily gluten-free. Gluten-free food items are clearly marked on the menu.

For dairy-free, vegan, and vegetarian diners, menu items are clearly marked. Several dishes have optional modifications.

Reviewers rave about:
* Sun temple IPA
* Chai stout
* Thai wings
* Mac and cheese with pork
* Adult tater tots
* Mexican lager

Spice Trade Brewing has two locations, the original in on Ralston Road in Arvada and the other on East Orchard Road in Greenwood Village.
