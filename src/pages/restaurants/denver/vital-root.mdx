Opened in 2016, Vital Root takes a fast-casual approach to plant-based meals that nourish the body and honor the earth.

The menu at Vital Root is entirely gluten-free and plant-based, so it’s great for gluten-free and vegetarian diners. The flavors range from Korean, Mexican, Thai, and even vegan versions of sports bar fair like queso and wings.

Note for gluten-free diners, they serve both gluten-free and non gluten-free beers.

For dairy-free and vegan diners, reviewers say many of the vegetarian dishes can be modified to be dairy-free and/or vegan, just ask your server.

Reviewers rave about:
* The patio that’s lined with cafeteria trays and an herb garden
* Sunflower risotto
* Pad thai
* Falafel
* Sweet potato fries
* Cashew queso
* Korean stir fry
* Pancakes

Vital Root is located on Tennyson Street in the Tennyson Art District.
