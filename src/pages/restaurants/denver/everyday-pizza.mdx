Opened in 2022 by the owners of Somebody People, Everyday Pizza serves vegetable-forward pizzas, pastas, and craft cocktails.

The menu at Everyday Pizza features appetizers, they call them disco bites, pastas, pizzas, desserts, and ice cream.

The pizzas are all 12 inches and are based around vegetables like Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, or squash, instead of meats.

For gluten-free diners, all the pastas have a gluten-free option and there is a gluten-pizza crust. Half the disco bites and desserts are gluten-free.

For dairy-free, vegan, and vegetarian diners, this is a completely vegan restaurant, so the pizza cheese, desserts, and ice cream should all be safe to eat.

Reviewers rave about:
* Cabbage appetizer
* Mushroom pizza
* Eggplant pizza
* Crushed tomato pizza
* Gemelli pasta
* Polpettone di Melanzane

Everyday Pizza is located on Larimer street, two blocks down from Coors field.
