Opened in 2009, Sweet Action Ice Cream is an unpretentious ice cream shop with a changing selection of inventive flavors and vegan options. All their ice cream is hand-made in small batches and churned using 100% wind power, so flavors rotate frequently.

For gluten-free diners, they may have gluten-free options, although nothing is noted on the online menu. Reviewers say they no longer use dedicated scoop or fresh tubs to avoid cross-contamination.

For dairy-free and vegan diners, they have several flavors of vegan sorbets and ice creams in each location.

Reviewers rave about the flavors:
* Cookies and cream
* Strawberry
* French chocolate malt
* M&M
* Mango chimango
* Salted butterscotch
* Peach cobbler

Sweet Action Ice Cream has seven locations, the original in Louisville, one in Longmont, two in Boulder, one in Aurora, and two in Denver, one in Highlands and one in Platt Park.
