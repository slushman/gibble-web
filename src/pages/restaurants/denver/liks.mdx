Opened in 1967, Liks Ice Cream is a Denver institution dishing up cups and cones in myriad innovative flavors, plus frozen yogurt and sorbet.

For gluten-free diners, they have gluten-free sugar cones and reviewers state they will wash hands and utensils upon request.

For dairy-free and vegan diners, they list four vegan ice creams, based on coconut milk, in addition to sorbets. Impressively, they have a list of their ingredients and allergens for each flavor available online. It is recommended to research ahead of time as it’s a very busy place.

Reviewers rave about the milkshakes and the ice cream flavors:
* Creamy praline
* Girl Scout Samoan
* Frozen cookie
* S’mores,
* Honey vanilla
* Butterscotch fudge ripple
* Dulce de Leche

Liks Ice Cream has two locations, one in Conifer, Colorado and one in Denver on East 13th Avenue in Capital Hill.
