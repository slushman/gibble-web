Opened in 1963, Rheinlander Bakery makes European-inspired treats such as strudels, baklava, bienenstich slice, nussecken, and shokolade pastry, streusel cookies, Dutch pies, and eclairs.

The menu at Rheinlander Bakery features many bakery standards, but specifically German, Greek, French, and Dutch pastries. They have entire menus of items for those on alternative diets, since they want to ensure there is something for everyone, because everyone deserves to treat themselves.
