Opened in 2014, Cheluna Brewing is a funky brewery inside an old aviation plant turned marketplace, pouring Latin and European style chelas, or beers.

The drinks menu at Cheluna Brewing features gluten-reduced beers, both seasonal and their flagship chelas.

For gluten-free drinkers, all the beers are gluten reduced, not gluten-free, except the Cheluna Colada IPA.

For diners, it does not appear that Cheluna serves its own food, but there are other vendors in Stanley marketplace and youâ€™re welcome to bring in your food.

Reviewers rave about:
* Lowrider 2, which is an amber Mexican lager
* Chilango
* IPA
* ESB
* Salted caramel and coco blend

Cheluna Brewing is located on Dallas Street in Stanley Marketplace in Aurora.
