Opened in 1998, Watercourse Foods is a 100% vegan restaurant.

The menu at Watercourse Foods features wide variety of scratch-made menu items that are accessible to many dietary restrictions and without preservatives, dyes, artificial colors or flavors, and hydrogenated fats.

For gluten-free diners, many recent reviewers mention a high risk of cross-contamination and that they do not have a separate gluten-free fryer. 

Watercourse gets its gluten-free baked goods from [Debyâ€™s Gluten Free](/restaurants/denver/debys-gluten-free), which is featured in our [gluten-free bakeries video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5puLRbNpSUc).

For dairy-free, soy-free, nut-free, vegan, and vegetarian diners, the menu clearly marks allergens.

Reviewers rave about:
* Buffalo tempeh sandwich
* Big Rig sandwich
* Double cauliflower chicken
* Mac and cheese with mushrooms
* Buffalo cauliflower wings
* Cuban sandwich
* Smoked turkey and brie sandwich with fig jam

Watercourse Foods is located on East 17th Avenue in the Uptown neighborhood.
